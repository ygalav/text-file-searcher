# text-file-searcher

1. No tests, sad but had no time
2. Implementation with the focus of flexible design but sill Searcher is bad, 
Index and Chunk knows more about each other, Searcher should NOT know internals of 
Index which needs to be abstracted


To run
0. Use java 13
1 Build jak with mvn clean package (or use the one i commit)
2. Run via java -jar test-file-searcher-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
